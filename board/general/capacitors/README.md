# A Statement to the Xbox Community About Xbox Capacitors

The original Xbox, a beloved console cherished by many, unfortunately fell victim to the infamous "capacitor plague."
This widespread issue plagued the gaming community between 1999 and 2007, primarily affecting non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors, particularly those from certain Taiwanese manufacturers.

The problem stemmed from a faulty electrolyte composition, leading to corrosion and gas generation within the capacitors.
This often resulted in the rupture of the capacitor's casing due to the pressure buildup, causing significant damage to the console and potentially rendering it inoperable.

Due to this, it is recommended to have your capacitors replaced.
It is possible to do it yourself, though we are not responsible for and damage caused by yourself.
